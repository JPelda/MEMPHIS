# MEMPHIS
Methodology to evaluate and map the potential of waste heat from sewage water by using internationally available open data


## Introduction
MEMPHIS enables you to build up a sewage system generically by using open data. The algorithm shall help to ease the implementation of waste heat from sewage systems identifying suitable locations for waste heat exploitation from sewer. Further information about the project is available at http://blogs.hawk-hhg.de/memphis/.

### Prerequisites

All packages used in this code come from anaconda distribution and are available without commercial use of anaconda.

## Acknowledgments

* Many thanks to the International Energy Agency (IEA) who are funding this research within the Technology Collaboration Programme on District Heating and Cooling including Combined Heat and Power named ANNEX XII. The research is about a methodology to evaluate and map the potential of waste heat from sewage water by using internationally available open data (MEMPHIS). It focuses on waste heat from small and medium industries as well as sewage networks and elaborates a tool to map potentials spatially. The project team consists of AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Building Research Establishment Limited (BRE) and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HAWK) in Göttingen. The project is led by HAWK.
* In addition, many thanks to the Göttinger Entsorgungsbetriebe (GEB) for supporting the project with their technical knowledge and providing their GIS data.
* Thanks to the open-source community, who provide professional tools and helped with programming challenges. Their work enables the project results to be freely distributed and utilized without costs.
